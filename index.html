                Berlin has long been a place where new technologies develop at a
                particularly rapid pace. In the early years, the city was a
                special breeding ground for blockchain technology with its
                subversive flair. Today, the technology has become an important
                economic factor with countless use-cases. See the latest in
                crypto + blockchain and business.
